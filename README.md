   Bypass Socket 

     •	The bypass socket is the segment of the Tendon-Driven Anthropomorphic Prosthesis (TDAP) that is worn over the forearm, wrist, and hand of an intact limb. All files        are included.

     •	Current sockets: rigid socket (v9), flexible socket (v3)

     Rigid v9 – full-size rigid socket for experimentation; hexagonal lattice allows for airflow while also allowing for haptic modalities to contact the skin; two pieces        are held together with magnets (see inventory spreadsheet for exact magnets) that travel through a slot on one piece

    Files

     •	Socket_v9_lattice – basic lattice piece without motor mounts

     •	Socket_v9_lattice_withmotors – lattice piece with integrated motor mounts

     •	Socket_v9_wrist – wrist cover piece

     •	Hand mount connector – printable adapter for wrist cover to hand connection
